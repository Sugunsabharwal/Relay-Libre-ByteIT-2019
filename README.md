# Participation Guide
Please follow these steps to get started:
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository to your local pc
3. Make the changes to the necessary files in the relevant folders

# Pull Request
Please keep these things in mind while creating a pull request:

1. Work in the current folder. Create a pull request from that branch of your forked version of the repository. 
    We will not accept the task submissions if the changes are made directly to the master branch.

2. Describe the changes that you have made in accordance with the task briefly.


# General Rules and Instructions
1. If at any point of time, a participant tries to copy other participants' submission, it will lead to immediate disqualification of the   participant from the event.
2. The first submission of each task will be awarded more bonus points than those awarded to the subsequent submissions. The only exception to this rule would be if the non-first submission is a really high-quality submission, in that case the same amount of points as the first one will be awarded to that participant.
